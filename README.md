The goal of this project is to check for misspelled words across large text files and suggest 1-3 most likely candidates.
Code is written using python programming language.
Used libraries:
1. NLTK (NLP library)
2. pyspellchecker (It uses a Levenshtein Distance algorithm to find permutations within an edit distance of 2 from the original word)
